    /* How to use specific topic Readers and Writers:

    The Topic specific Reader Constructor -  can be used to update Topic Specific Content filters 
     - e.g. in the case of a device Reader, it should register for myTopic - i.e.
     commands directed specifically to it from a controller.

    The controller readers likely would not want to filter for a specific deviceID,
    as generally controllers handle all the data sent to them. Controllers typically
    are not a specific target ID either.

    The Topic specific Writer member functions. 

    Topic Writer have the topic specific 
    Specific Writer Handlers have two parts, the Initial Setup and the Handler Loop.
    The user may want add code  in the Initial Setup (prior to the Handler Loop) to
    statically set the source ID (in the case of a device) or any other static data. 
    This is done once and is topic specific.

    Code can be added in the loop write the topic periodically. If non periodic, the loop
    can be used for writer event status and sleep periodically with no write operation.
    A separate writeData(data) member funcstion can be added to the specific topic class to
    allow the main program to set data and write at will.
